Hello.My Name Is Argho Bakshi.I am a Web Developer.This Is My First Project.
The term X-Flora means 10 flowers I have decided this as the name of my website because
when  I was going to publish my website on internet that time it contained information about ten flowers.
The prime function of this website is to distrubute knowledge about flowers among all for free of cost.
This website is developed only using pure html there is no other languages used to  devlop this website.
You can help me to improve this website by giving suggestions and informing me about bugs.
Hope You Like It.
